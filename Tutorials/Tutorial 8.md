# Practical 8 – Flow Control: Loops


In this practical you will learn how to control program flow using three different types of loops: 

1. the **while** loop.
2. the **do-while** loop. 
3. the **for** loop 

## While
In previous sessions the large majority of exercises have employed a ‘never-ending’ while(true) loop. Last week we learned that it was possible to control the number of times the loop cycled with a condition in place of the true keyword. 

From now on, you should only include loops in your program if you need one, and it should **always** be controlled by a conditional statement, such that it is possible to exit the program in some way.
