## Class

In the real world we are used to seeing, discussing, and using objects. For example, your mobile phone is one of many mobile phones in the world. However, it shares a number of characteristics and features with all other phones. We can think of a generic mobile phone as the **class or data type** and your specific phone as the **instance or variable name.**
